    <string name="aboutUs">Just less than a year ago, we became fascinated by the idea of developing an AI first aid assistant. What if anyone could carry out first aid just as good as trained first aiders? Or gain access to medical knowledge which could be useful during emergencies? It may sound eccentric but what if we could make it happen? All in one app. All in your hands. That is AIDIWOW.</string>
